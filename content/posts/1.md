## Introduction

This guide will mainly be focused around Debian based Linux distributions, such as Linux Mint, Ubuntu, etc, but it should be fairly simple to adapt these instructions to work with your torrent client of choice. We will also be mainly using docker compose for ease of config



## Installing Docker

Installing docker is best done by following the official instructions. These can be found at

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/



## Setting up torrent clients

There are a variety of torrent clients available, and we will be covering 3, qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge



### Setting up qBittorrent

#### [qBittorrent Website](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)

First, start by creating a directory where we will be storing our config for qBittorrent

```
mkdir qbittorrent-docker
```

Then open the directory and create a docker compose file

```
cd qbittorrent-docker
nano docker-compose.yml
```

We will be using the LinuxServer.io image, which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/qbittorrent)

Paste the following text into the `docker-compose.yml`

```
---
services:
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    container_name: qbittorrent
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./downloads:/downloads
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 6881:6881
      - 6881:6881/udp
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Change the TZ according to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), and if you want to change the port for the webUI, change `8080:8080` to `6081:8080` or whatever you like.


In order to change the torrent port which will need to be port forwarded, change the `6881:6881` and `6881:6881/udp` to `50000:6881` and `50000:6881/udp` or however you like

 
Finally, change the path to downloads to however you like, or leave it default to make it download into `qbittorrent-docker/downloads`


Now use the following commands to run the docker container

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```

**Pay attention to the output of the last command, it contains your login password that qBittorrent generated**

![Image](/1/qbittorrent_login.png)

If you get an error similar to `docker compose: command not found`, try `docker-compose ...` instead.


qBittorrent should now be available on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` on a local machine and `http://ip:8080` on a remote machine


If you cannot see the torrent client online, try checking your firewall or port forwarding settings


We are not setup just yet though, so just hold on for a little while. Login to the web interface of the torrent client and change the login password to something you have securely stored.


Now close the qBittorrent instance by pressing `CTRL+C` in the window where you ran `docker compose up`, and then run the following command

```
docker compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag tells docker compose to run our container in the background, so you don't need to keep a terminal window open to keep the torrent client running


With that qBittorrent is installed! Continue with further configuration on the web interface or continue to the reverse proxy instructions to connect your torrent client to a domain name and use HTTPS to secure the connection, like https://qbittorrent.domain.tld



### Setting up Deluge

#### [Deluge Website](https://deluge-torrent.org/)

Installing Deluge will be almost identical to qBittorrent

First, start by creating a directory where we will be storing our config for Deluge

```
mkdir deluge-docker
```

Then open the directory and create a docker compose file

```
cd deluge-docker
nano docker-compose.yml
```

We will be using the LinuxServer.io image, which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/deluge)

Paste the following text into the `docker-compose.yml`

```
---
services:
  deluge:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/deluge:latest
    container_name: deluge
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - DELUGE_LOGLEVEL=error #optional
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./downloads:/downloads
    ports:
      - 8112:8112
      - 6881:6881
      - 6881:6881/udp
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Change the TZ according to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), and if you want to change the port for the webUI, change `8112:8112` to `6081:8112` or whatever you like.


In order to change the torrent port which will need to be port forwarded, change the `6881:6881` and `6881:6881/udp` to `50000:6881` and `50000:6881/udp` or however you like

 
Finally, change the path to downloads to however you like, or leave it default to make it download into `deluge-docker/downloads`


Now use the following commands to run the docker container

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

If you get an error similar to `docker compose: command not found`, try `docker-compose ...` instead.


Deluge should now be available on `http://127.0.0.1:8112` on a local machine and `http://ip:8112` on a remote machine


If you cannot see the torrent client online, try checking your firewall or port forwarding settings


The default password is `deluge`



### Setting up Transmission

#### [Transmission Website](https://transmissionbt.com/)

Installing Transmission will be almost identical to qBittorrent and Deluge, since we are using docker

First, start by creating a directory where we will be storing our config for Transmission

```
mkdir transmission-docker
```

Then open the directory and create a docker compose file

```
cd transmission-docker
nano docker-compose.yml
```

We will be using the LinuxServer.io image, which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/transmission)

Paste the following text into the `docker-compose.yml`

```
---
services:
  transmission:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/transmission:latest
    container_name: transmission
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - USER= #optional
      - PASS= #optional
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./downloads:/downloads #optional
    ports:
      - 9091:9091
      - 51413:51413
      - 51413:51413/udp
    restart: unless-stopped

```

Change the TZ according to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), and if you want to change the port for the webUI, change `9091:9091` to `6081:9091` or whatever you like.

You will need to change the `USER` and `PASS` values to your preffered login credentials.

In order to change the torrent port which will need to be port forwarded, change the `51413:51413` and `51413:51413/udp` to `50000:51413` and `50000:51413/udp` or however you like
 

Finally, change the path to downloads to however you like, or leave it default to make it download into `transmission-docker/downloads`


Now use the following commands to run the docker container

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

If you get an error similar to `docker compose: command not found`, try `docker-compose ...` instead.


Transmission should now be available on `http://127.0.0.1:9091` on a local machine and `http://ip:9091` on a remote machine


If you cannot see the torrent client online, try checking your firewall or port forwarding settings
